# SDTM-Mapping-and-Automation

PointCross Life Sciences demonstrated a novel approach to [automate the mapping of unprocessed clinical EDC and non-EDC](https://pointcrosslifesciences.com/edc-raw-data-to-sdtm-curation-mapping-and-automation-with-the-xbiom-tool/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=edc-raw-data-to-sdtm-curation-mapping-and-automation-with-the-xbiom-tool) (biomarker) data to SDTM mapping through a Universal Data Model at PHUSE US Connect 2023. They also  explained how SDTM programming and mapping for statistical analysis outputs has traditionally been labour and code intensive, reducing the time to SDTM from weeks to days with built-in traceability.
